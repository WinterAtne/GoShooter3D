This game will not be officially published, it is simply a learning tool for myself. I have three goals:

1) Impliment a basic 3D model (Complete)
2) Create a simple shooting mechanic (Complete)
3) Create a basic movement mechanic (Complete)
4) Make some post processing effects (Complete/Half-assed)
